# why cloud ?

- before cloud we have to buy severs
- high traffic more server
- monitoring and maintaining servers
- servers are costly

## problems

- trouble shooting is a main problem
- traffic is not constant(severs are not used efficiently)
- large amount of data

## cloud

- storing data
- processing data
- accessing data
- collection of data centers
- cloud with unlimited space
- rent resources what is needed and pay for that only
- focus more on bushiness

## serverless

- serverless != no server
- developer don't have to worry about writing code for server, develop server
- focus on bushiness logic
- pay as use
