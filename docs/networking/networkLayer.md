Forwarding Table

## Forwarding table

- Router has forwarding table
- A router forwards packet by examining the value in header field  of arriving packet
- Use this header value to index into the router’s forwarding table.
- In table, value for that header indicates the router’s outgoing link interface to
which that packet is to be forwarded.
- Depending network-layer protocol,the header value could be the destination address or an indication of connection to which the packet belongs.

## Internal of a Router

**Function of router**

- **forwarding**
- **routing**

![router](routerArchitecture.png)

**Input ports**

- packets are admitted into the router
- terminate physical link layer at the router
- lookup function performed at input port
  - forwarding table consulted here to determine which output port for incoming packets

**Switching fabric**

- connects the router's input ports to its output ports.
- completely contained within the router
- its like network inside a network router

**Output ports**

- stores packets received from switching fabric
- and transmits to out going layer by performing link-layer and physical-layer function

**Routing processor**

- execute routing protocols
- maintains routing tables
- computes the forward table for router
- perform network management functions

## Switching

ways to do switching(forwarding)

- Switching via memory
- Switching via bus
- Switching via interconnection network

## IP : Forwarding and addressing in the Internet

3 major component of Internet's network layer

- IP protocol
- routing protocol
- facility to report errors, ICMP

_network layer packet is referred as datagram_

**syntax and semantics of IPv4 datagram format**

![ipv4 format](ipv4format.png)

_**Version number**_

- 4 bit, IP protocol version of datagram
- helps router to determine how to interpret reminder of IP datagram
- different version of IP use different datagram format

_**Header length**_

- 20 byte header, determine where in IP datagram the data actually begin

_**Type of service**_

- allow different type of IP datagram(_eg real time datagram , non-real time datagram_ )

 **_Data gram length_**

- total length of IP datagram(header+data)
- 16 bits

_**Identifier,flags,fragmentation offset**_

- deal with IP fragmentation
- IPv6 doesn't allow for fragmentation at routers

_**Time-to-live**_

- ensure that datagram do not circulate forever in network
- decremented by 1 each time datagram is processed by a router
- 0 TTL - datagram must be drop

_**Protocol**_

- used when datagram reaches destination
- protocol number indicate the specific transport-layer protocol to which the data portion of this datagram should be passed
- eg: 6-TCP,17-UDP
- binds network and transport layer

**_Header checksum_**

- detect bit errors in received IP datagram
- if checksum carried by datagram != computed checksum then router display _discard datagram_

**_Source and destination IP address_**

**_options_**

- allow ip header to be extended

**_Data_**

- contains transport layer segment (TCP or UDP or ICMP massages )

## IP Datagram Fragmentation

- some protocol carry big gram some carry small datagrams
- that is different protocol has different _maximum transmission unit_.

**what cause data fragmentation ?**

- each links along the route between sender, destination can use different link-layer protocol
- and each of these link can have different `MTU`
- eg: router receive an IP datagram from one link- check forwarding table choose the outgoing link , and find that `MTU` of this link is smaller than length of IP datagram.

**fragmentation**

- Fragment data in IP datagram into two or more smaller ip datagram,
- encapsulate each of these smaller IP datagram in a separate link-layer frame
- send these frame over outgoing link
- each of these smaller datagram is referred as _fragment_

**points**

- fragments needs to reassemble before reaching transport layer at destination
- destination host reassembles the fragments
- destination host examine the(_identification flag , fragmentation offset_) identification number of datagrams stamped by sending host
- IP is unreliable - one or more fragment won't arrive at destination
- so , last fragment is flag=0,other marked as flag =1
- if more that one or more doesn't arrive, incomplete datagram is discarded
- TCP will recover this loss by retransmitting data by source

**drawback**

- complicate routers and end system
- can be used to create lethal DoS attacks, hacker send series of unexpected fragments eg: _Jolt2 attack_

![fragmentation](fragmentation.png)

![fragment table](IpfragmentTabel.png)

## IPv4 Addressing

**interface**

- The boundary between the router and any of its link
- router have multiple links therefore have multiple interface
- every router and host, receiving and sending datagram, therefore every interface should have IP address.

**IP Address**

- 32 bit long(4 bytes) - 2^32 possible ip address - 4billion
- written dotted-decimal-notation
- IP address 193.32.216.9 - 8bit.8bit.8bit.8bit
- each interface of router and host have unique IP address

**_subnet_**- interconnecting 3 host interface (fig 4.15)

**_subnet mask_**

- IP addressing assigns an address to this
subnet: 223.1.1.0/24, where the /24 notation, sometimes known as a `subnet mask`
- The subnet 223.1.1.0/24 consists of three host interfaces :
(223.1.1.1, 223.1.1.2, and 223.1.1.3) <br>
one router interface :(223.1.1.4).

![subnet](subnet1.png)
![subnet](subnet2.png)

**_CIDR_**
internet's address assignment strategy is known as `Classless Interdomain Routing`
_a.b.c.d/x_ <br>
_x_ : no of bits in first part of address <br>
_x_ most significant bits referred as **_prefix_**

organisation assigned a range of address with comman prefix.IP address of devices within the organisation share comman prefix.

**_classful addressing_**
before CIDR was adopted,network portions of an IP address were constrained to be 8, 16, or 24 bits in length<br>
8 - class A <br>
16- class B <br>
24- class C <br>
subnet portion : 1,2,3 bits long <br>
class C (/24) subnet could accommodate only up to 2^8 – 2 = 254 hosts

**_broadcast address_**

IP broadcast address 255.255.255.255.
When a host sends a datagram with destination address 255.255.255.255, the message is delivered to all hosts on the same subnet.

### **how range of ip address is obtain**

- network admin contact ISP
- IP address are managed under the authority of  ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Name and numbers)
- ICANN - assign ip adress as well as manage DNS servers

### **Obtaning a Host Address: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**

- once organization got addresses, it assign to host and routers interface
- `DHPC`allows a host to obtain IP address automatically
- network admin can configure DHCP so that given host receives the same IP address each time it connect to the network
- or host may assign _temporary IP address_ , it will be different each time host connect to network
- DHCP allows host to learn info such as its <br>
  - subnet mask ,
  - the address of its first top router(default gateway)
  - address of local DNS server
- also refer as **plug play protocol** : ability to automate network-related aspects of connecting host into a network
- used in residential Internet access network , host join and leaves network frequently
- DHCP is ideally suited for the situation where many users are coming and going and addresses are needed for limited amount of time
- DHCP is a client server protocol
- each subnet has a DHCP server.If no server present on the subnet
- DHPC relay agent that knows the address of DHPC server

![DHPC](DHPC.png)

### **DHPC is a 4 step process**

![process](DHPC_process.png)

**DHPC server discovery**

- First message is generated the communication between server and client
- message sent by client in-order to discover whether any DHPC server is present or not
- message is broadcasted

**DHPC server offers**

- server respond to host in this message specifying unleashed Ip address and other TCP info
- message is broadcasted by server
- size of message 342 bytes
- if more than one DHPC server present client accept first DHCP offer message it receive
- serve Id is specified in the packet

**DHPC request**

- the newly arrive client will chose from among on or more offers and respond to selected offer with DHCP request message
- echoing back config parameters

**DHPC ACK**

- server respond to DHCP request message with DHPC ACK message , confirming request parameters

Once client revives DHCP ACK interaction in complete
client can use DHCP-allocated IP address for the lease duration

### Shortcoming

- new IP address is obtain from DHCP each time connect to new subnet
TCP connection to a remote app can be maintained as mobile node moves between subnets

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

- IT's a way to map multiple local private addresses to public before transferring the information
- Organization that want multiple devices to employ single ip address use NAT
- eg: home routers
- let say ,request made in web from your laptop , request send to router in form of packet.
- router changes outgoing private local ip address to public address.
- because the receiving server won't know where to send information back. As device iP is private local .
- NAT behaves like a single device with a single ip , for outside world

![nat](nat.png)

**how home network devices get the ip address**

- NAT router get ip address from ISP's DHCP server
- router runs DHCP server to provide addresses to computers within NAT-DHCP-router-controlled home network's address space

**NAT Table**

- use to tell where/which host to forward given datagram
**security**
- `NAT` hiding details of home network from outside world

**NAT face agues**

- port numbers are meant to be used for addressing processes, not for
addressing hosts
- routers
are supposed to process packets only up to layer 3
- NAT
protocol violates the so-called end-to-end argument
- we should use IPv6 to
solve the shortage of IP addresses, rather than recklessly patching up the problem
with a stopgap solution like NAT

**problem with NAT in P2P application**

- P2P app : participating Peer A should be able to initiate TCP connection with other peer B
- problem is Peer B is behind NAT, it can't act as server and accept TCP connection
- this NAT problem can be circumvented if Peer A is not behind a NAT
- Peer A can first contact PeerB through an intermediate Peer C, which is not behind a NAT and to which B has
established an ongoing TCP connection.
- Peer A can then ask Peer B, via Peer C, to initiate a TCP connection directly back to Peer A.
- Once the direct P2P TCP connection is established between Peers A and B, the two peers can exchange messages or
files. This hack, called connection reversal
-

### **UPnP Universal Plug and Play**

- which is
a protocol that allows a host to discover and configure a nearby NAT

## Internet Control Message Protocol

- use of ICMP is for error reporting.
- For example, when running a Telnet, FTP, or HTTP session,you may seen error message such as “Destination network unreachable.”
- CMP messages have
  - type and a code field
  - the header and the first 8 bytes of the IP datagram that caused the ICMP message to be generated in the
first place (so that the sender can determine the datagram that caused the error).
- ping program sends an ICMP type 8 code 0 message to the specified host.
- **_source quench message_** : ts original purpose was to perform congestion control—
to allow a congested router to send an ICMP source quench message to a host to
force that host to reduce its transmission rate.
- Traceroute is implemented with ICMP messages. To determine the names and addresses of the routers
between source and destination

![IMCP](ICMP.png)

## IPv6

![ipv6](ipv6.png)

### **how will public Internet, which is based on IPv4 transitioned to IPV6**

**dual-stack approach**

![dualstack](dualstack.png)

- where IPv6 nodes also have a complete IPv4 implementation.
Such a node, referred to as an IPv6/IPv4 node
- has the ability to send and receive both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams
- IPv6/IPv4 nodes must have both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses
- DNS which can return an IPv6 address if the node name being resolved is IPv6-capable, or other-
wise return an IPv4 address.

**tunneling**
![tunnling](tunneling.png)

## A brief Foray into IP Security

- One of these protocols is IPsec, one of the more popular secure network-layer protocols and also widely deployed in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- if two hosts want to securely communicate, IPsec
needs to be available only in those two hosts. All other routers and hosts can continue to run vanilla IPv4.
- When two hosts have an IPsec session established between them, all TCP andUDP segments sent between them will be encrypted and authenticated

**services provided by IPsec**

- **Cryptographic agreement** Mechanisms that allow the two communicating hosts
to agree on cryptographic algorithms and keys.
- **Encryption of IP datagram payloads**. When the sending host receives a segment
from the transport layer, IPsec encrypts the payload. The payload can only be
decrypted by IPsec in the receiving host
- **Data integrity** IPsec allows the receiving host to verify that the datagram’s
header fields and encrypted payload were not modified while the datagram was
en route from source to destination.
- **Origin authentication** When a host receives an IPsec datagram from a trusted
source, the host is assured that the source IP address in the datagram is the actual source of the datagram.
